Hack the Box’s OSINT Challenge category. I’m a big fan of information gathering challenges and find open source intelligence
to be an incredibly interesting topic overall and have found that so far the challenges on Hack the Box do not dissappoint.
The following is a writeup for the Infiltration challenge I recently completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released just over two years ago, the Infiltration OSINT challenge reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can you find something to help you break into the company ‘Evil Corp LLC’. Recon social media sites to see if you can find any useful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this out of the way (and appreciating the nice reference to Mr. Robot), it’s time to proceed through the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;information-gathering&quot;&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick search on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Evil Corp LLC&lt;/code&gt; in DuckDuckGo quickly reveals that this organization at the very least has its own Linkedin page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/linkedin-evil-corp.png&quot; alt=&quot;A DuckDuckGo search result on Evil Corp LLC displaying the top result, a link to its Linkedin page&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s noteworthy that in the description here is a value of text that looks very much like a HTB flag.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/linkedin-evil-corp2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The front page of evil corp LLC on Linkedin, featuring a short description, employee count, and buttons for following the compnany on Linkedin or visiting their website.&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and decoded the text of this value. As expected, it’s not the flag I’m looking for, but it does appear that I’m on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/decoded-message.png&quot; alt=&quot;The decoded message of the the value which says: You can do this, keep going!!!&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving along to Evil Corp’s posts and other topics, it appears that the organization only has one visible post on their feed. It’s just one post, but with
multiple interactions from employees at the company, there may be some extra information to gather here. In particular, these two employees here seem to belong to Evil Corp, so there might be some valuable information on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/linkedin-members.png&quot; alt=&quot;The comments of two Evil Corp employees, Alia Mccarty and Abel Bullock&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the one interaction on Linkedin, Alia Mccarty’s profile had little additional information. However, a quick Google search 
on Mccarty shows that she also appears to have a Twitter profile. She has only a few tweets, but one in particular caught my attention, a tweet
with what appears to be half of a Hack the Box flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/alia-mccarty-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;A post of Alia Mccarty's with what appears to be half of a HTB flag&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around the profile a little more, but couldn’t find any other pieces that would connect to this particular piece of text. Since the 
challenge emphasises actually &lt;em&gt;breaking in&lt;/em&gt; to Evil Corp, I headed back to LinkedIn to look at some more profiles that might have information
which is more consistent with the challenge description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the original post that Evil Corp made on its Linkedin, I was also able to view Abel Bullock’s profile, but his profile had little additional
information, and DuckDuckGo and Google searches did not return any other profiles for this particular user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/abel-bullock-linkedin.png&quot; alt=&quot;The front page of Abel Bullock's profile, fairly non-descriptive&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With not much else to go on for these users, I returned back to Evil Corp’s page to see if there was a way I could discover any new employees of Evil Corp,
as supposedly some 53 users are part of the company, so there may be other profiles to look through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I find interesting about Linkedin’s permissions for viewing profiles is that the ability for a user to view another Linkedin user’s profile is largely
based on the vector that one takes in order to view a profile. 
For example, searching for a list of people that are employees of Evil Corp reveals a large list of users that have names ommitted and which are replaced instead
with the text &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Linkedin Member&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/linkedin-members2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A list of Linkedin members with most details except for job title ommitted&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, if a user is viewing the profile of someone such as an Evil Corp employee like Abel Bullock mentioned earlier, Linkedin will graciously offer the names
of additional profiles that were viewed by other users on Linkedin, some of which appear to be employees of Evil Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/linkedin-members3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Another list of Linkedin members, this time with details included&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, Eryn Mcmahon’s profile appears to be included in both this list and the other less detailed list of users noted earlier. Like Abel Bullock and 
Alia Mccarty’s profiles however, Eryn’s profile seemed to also have very little information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough however, a DuckDuckGo search revealed that Eryn does have an Instagram profile, so there may be some additional information here to help 
with finding the flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/eryn-instagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;DuckDuckGo search result showing that Eryn Mcmahon appears to have an Instagram profile&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away, one post that sticks out to me features a laptop with what appears to be an employee badge which is mostly visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/eryn-instagram2.png&quot; alt=&quot;An overview of Eryn Mcmahon's Instagram profile which consists of mostly stock photos&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look, it looks like the badge in the photo has Eryn’s name, her title at Evil Corp, a barcode, and a long string of text at the bottom which 
appears to be formatted like a HTB flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/eryn-instagram3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of one of Eryn Mcmahon's posts&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faint enough as it is, I enlarged this image using Paint and then entered this flag into the challenge submission. Success! Looks like we’ll be able to infiltrate Evil Corp. Mr. Robot would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I did find this challenge to be fairly simple overall. However, I still encounter situations like this on a regular basis in my own networks.
While not necessarily to the extent of this challenge, I do ocasionally see aquaintances and sometimes even close friends being lackadaisical with
their information when posting to social media. This challenge in particular served as a great reminder that while social media can be an effective tool to share information, we should always aim to be cautious about how much and what type of information we share. Onward to the next challenge!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Benz</name></author><category term="journal" /><category term="documentation" /><category term="sample" /><summary type="html">Apart from many of the other challenges on Hack the Box, some of my favorites that I’ve worked on recently have been from Hack the Box’s OSINT Challenge category.

While many of my own resolutions that I procured at the end of 2019 were stopped dead in their tracks this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic (farewell to a desire of travelling more), I discovered some additional ways of improvement I had not thought of in my initial reflection of 2019 by learning more about the threats posed to individuals and organizations from a security perspective, and what we as individuals can do to improve our security posture to protect our data, accounts, and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of the “resolutions” noted below consist of tips or tools I currently or have started to include in my own security posture, I’ve curated the points below to be in a digestable format for family, friends, colleagues, and anyone else looking to learn a little bit more about security and/or better mitigate risk to their personal assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improved-password-hygiene&quot;&gt;Improved Password Hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that passwords remain commonplace from everything to grocery store apps to banking logins, good password hygiene across all surfaces is necessary to ensure that we can keep our accounts secure with a fair amount of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pasword-structure&quot;&gt;Pasword Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many websites will enforce specific policies for complex passwords, password length is another aspect that one should keep in mind when building a strong password. This post from xkcd on password strength summarizes the need not only for complexity in a password, but also length, with preference towards building a passphrase that is long and easy to remember over a single password that includes complexity but is difficult to remember and can potentially be cracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png&quot; alt=&quot;A word on password strength from xkcd. While shorter, complex passwords may appear strong, a lack of length could make passwords easier to crack for computers, while being difficult for humans to remember&quot; title=&quot;Password Stength&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pasword-storage&quot;&gt;Pasword Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a growing amount of services requiring registration for accounts, it is a nearly impossible task to remember all of the credentials a user might need at some point, especially if those credentials are only ever used on occasion. A good password manager ensures that multiple credentials can be stored securely, alleviating the worry of having to remember numerous logins or keep track of logins in an unsecure manner (a piece of paper, the Word doc sitting on your Desktop, etc). Two password managers worth noting are &lt;a href=&quot;https://keepassxc.org/&quot;&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, both of which utilize AES-256 bit encryption and which can be hosted locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multi-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;Multi Factor Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is becoming increasingly common for services and hardware to allow users to setup two factor authentication on their logins. Additional steps which can be added to a password often include a user providing a fingerprint, software token, SMS code, or hardware token. While 2FA isn’t a guarantee on every serivce, it’s worth setting up when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sms-authentication&quot;&gt;SMS Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SMS based authentication, users can receive a text message to their mobile device containing a code to be used at login. While using SMS is certainly better than nothing in terms of a 2FA posture, attacks such as SIM swap fraud and SMS interception have demonstrated that texts are not the ideal method for authentication, especially on sensitive accounts. While still common, many services are moving away from SMS based authentication in favor of software generated tokens or hardware tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-tokens&quot;&gt;Software Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With software based authenticators, users only need to download a 2FA app such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://authy.com/&quot;&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator&quot;&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; and add a supported account to the app, usually by scanning a QR code or entering a passphrase. Following setup, at login a user will be prompted for a soft token generated by the 2FA app on their device (usually a 6 or 7 digit code). These codes typically only last a a few seconds, at which point a new token is generated by the 2FA application, mitigating risk against potential code interception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hardware-tokens&quot;&gt;Hardware Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to software based authenticators, hardware tokens are keyfob-like devices that can generate codes similar to software based authenticators which are then entered at login. While not completely immune to attack, hardware tokens offer another way of utilizing 2FA to upgrade one’s security. These days, I’m also seeing a lot of attention towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/&quot;&gt;YubiKeys&lt;/a&gt; as a way of authenticating to mobile devices, personal computers, online services and more. For those going the YubiKey route, it’s worth having a second spare key stored somewhere safely, just in case a key gets lost or broken (I’ve seen some skepticism on the reviews of sites such as Amazon on the long term durability of these keys).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Benz</name></author><category term="journal" /><category term="documentation" /><category term="sample" /><summary type="html">As 2020 comes to a close as one of the most exhausting years in recent memory, I figured now might be as good of a time as ever to review some resolutions with regards to security posture.
