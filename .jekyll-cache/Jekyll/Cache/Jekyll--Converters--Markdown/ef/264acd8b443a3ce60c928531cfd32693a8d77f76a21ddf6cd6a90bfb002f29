I"><p>Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website. While I am currently a software developer,
I also enjoy studying cybersecurity, learning new tools for web application pentesting, and pursuing bug bounty opportunities. I also use this site to blog, and will upload any posts or articles related to security here.</p>
