I"ò<p>As 2020 comes to a close as one of the most exhausting years in recent memory, I figured now might be as good of a time as ever to review some resolutions with regards to security posture. While many of my own resolutions that I procured at the end of 2019 were stopped dead in their tracks this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic (farewell to a desire of travelling more), I discovered some additional ways of improvement I had not thought of in my initial reflection of 2019 by learning more about the threats posed to individuals and organizations from a security perspective, and what we as individuals can do to improve our security posture to protect our data, accounts, and other resources.</p>

<p>While many of the ‚Äúresolutions‚Äù noted below consist of tips or tools I currently or have started to include in my own security posture, I‚Äôve curated the points below to be in a digestable format for family, friends, colleagues, and anyone else looking to learn a little bit more about security and/or better mitigate risk to their personal assets.</p>

<h2 id="improved-password-hygiene">Improved Password Hygiene</h2>
<p>Considering that passwords remain commonplace from everything to grocery store apps to banking logins, good password hygiene across all surfaces is necessary to ensure that we can keep our accounts secure with a fair amount of security.</p>

<h3 id="pasword-structure">Pasword Structure</h3>
<p>While many websites will enforce specific policies for complex passwords, password length is another aspect that one should keep in mind when building a strong password. This post from xkcd on password strength summarizes the need not only for complexity in a password, but also length, with preference towards building a passphrase that is long and easy to remember over a single password that includes complexity but is difficult to remember and can potentially be cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png" alt="A word on password strength from xkcd. While shorter, complex passwords may appear strong, a lack of length could make passwords easier to crack for computers, while being difficult for humans to remember" title="Password Stength" /></p>

<h3 id="pasword-storage">Pasword Storage</h3>
<p>With a growing amount of services requiring registration for accounts, it is a nearly impossible task to remember all of the credentials a user might need at some point, especially if those credentials are only ever used on occasion. A good password manager ensures that multiple credentials can be stored securely, alleviating the worry of having to remember numerous logins or keep track of logins in an unsecure manner (a piece of paper, the Word doc sitting on your Desktop, etc). Two password managers worth noting are <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> and <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, both of which utilize AES-256 bit encryption and which can be hosted locally.</p>

<h2 id="multi-factor-authentication">Multi Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>It is becoming increasingly common for services and hardware to allow users to setup two factor authentication on their logins. Additional steps which can be added to a password often include a user providing a fingerprint, software token, SMS code, or hardware token. While 2FA isn‚Äôt a guarantee on every serivce, it‚Äôs worth setting up when possible.</p>

<h3 id="sms-authentication">SMS Authentication</h3>
<p>With SMS based authentication, users can receive a text message to their mobile device containing a code to be used at login. While using SMS is certainly better than nothing in terms of a 2FA posture, attacks such as SIM swap fraud and SMS interception have demonstrated that texts are not the ideal method for authentication, especially on sensitive accounts. While still common, many services are moving away from SMS based authentication in favor of software generated tokens or hardware tokens.</p>

<h3 id="software-tokens">Software Tokens</h3>
<p>With software based authenticators, users only need to download a 2FA app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator">Microsoft Authenticator</a>, or <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> and add a supported account to the app, usually by scanning a QR code or entering a passphrase. Following setup, at login a user will be prompted for a soft token generated by the 2FA app on their device (usually a 6 or 7 digit code). These codes typically only last a a few seconds, at which point a new token is generated by the 2FA application.</p>
